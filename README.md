# Simulated Wireless Sensor Network
This project is a simulation of a Wireless Sensor Network implemented in C++. It will use a library made by me and @LucasStarlingdePaulaSalles for the discipline "Programação e Desenvolvimento de Software 2" of the university Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais.

The purpose of this project is to create a boilerplate that we will eventually use to develop a more robust WSN simulation in the web environment. It will also allow us to test the persistent library we have created and enhance it little by little.



The persistent-data-storage that we will use can be found [here](https://github.com/lucasclopesr/persistent-data-storage).
